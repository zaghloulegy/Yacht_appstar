# Yacht_appstar
## Introduction
---
Most people don't own a yacht. Yet to become a certified RYA Skipper you need to Log the right amount of experience at sea, before being able to take an RYA Sail Cruising Course and Exam. When spending time on a sailing yacht, life is busy. The last thing you are going to remember to do when you have moored at the marina after an intense few days of sailing is take a photo of the Ship's Log! Here's where we come in: 

Yacht Mappster tracks the time you spend on other people's vessels and compiles it into a handy personal Nav Log. Just tell us when you're onboard a vessel. 

We will tell you how many miles you've sailed, how many night hours you've been underway, your, course, heading, speed... we can even give you the total number of hours you've been in command of the vessel! We will then generate a handy, portable Personal Nav Log of all your experience as a Yachtsperson, in PDF format to keep and share. 

## Development process
---
This app was developped while using agile practices. Code counldn't be merged to the main branch without 2 other members reviewing and approving the code. Stand ups were had each morning, each member spoke about what they did the previous day, what was blocking their progress and what they were going to do today. Kanban boards were used in the stand ups and referred to throughout the day. Much of the code was written while pair or mob programming.
