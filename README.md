Most people don't own a yacht... 

Kyle is no exception (for now). Yet to become a certified RYA Skipper you need to Log the right amount of experience at sea, before being able to take an RYA Sail Cruising Course and Exam. When spending time on a sailing yacht, life is busy. The last thing you are going to remember to do when you have moored at the marina after an intense few days of sailing is take a photo of the Ship's Log! Here's where we come in: 

Yacht Mappster tracks the time you spend on other people's vessels and compiles it into a handy personal Nav Log. Just tell us when you're onboard a vessel. 

We'll do the rest! 

We will tell you how many miles you've sailed, how many night hours you've been underway, your, course, heading, speed... we can even give you the total number of hours you've been in command of the vessel! 

We will then generate a handy, portable Personal Nav Log of all your experience as a Yachtsperson, in PDF format to keep and share. 

Simple!
